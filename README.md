# WTWR (What to Wear?) – Backend

## Project Description

This is the backend for the WTWR (What to Wear?) application, a full-stack project that helps users decide what to wear based on the weather.

## The backend handles:

- Secure API requests with validation and error handling.
  The project is fully deployed with custom domains and SSL.

## Technologies & Techniques Used

- Node.js & Express.js – Backend framework.
- MongoDB & Mongoose – Database & schemas.
